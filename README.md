### Description

**FuzzyStatTraEOO** is an open source package for the **R** environment that contains the package 'FuzzyStatTra' in Encapsulated Object Oriented Programming. 'FuzzyStatTra' contains Statistical Methods for Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers, whose aim is to provide some basic functions for doing statistical analysis with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.

Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are widely used in fuzzy scale rates in Social, Educational Sciences and many other disciplines as a strong alternative to both traditional Likert-type or visual analogue scales in some questionnaires measuring people's behavior (attitudes, opinions, perceptions, feelings, etc.). This type of data can not be directly measured because it concerns inherently imprecise features. Likert-type and visual analogue scales force respondents to choose single-point answers linked to some items (statements or questions), so individual differences are almost systematically overlooked.

Now, those functions are organized in specific encapsulated classes and methods with reference semantincs using the published R package **R6**. This object-based approach is an important step in making statistical computing more accessible to users.

Finally, it should also be remarked that the **FuzzyStatTraEOO** package includes some real-life data sets.
